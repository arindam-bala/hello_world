Basic Ideas about coding
Hi... This is Arindam here. I am a computer science engineer. I love coding and digital electronics specially embedded system designing.
This is my first Git practice. I am enjoying it and I will use this great technology for developing my codes,circuit diagrams,libraries,program files and projects in future. I am really happy with this great platform. Thank you Github.
